Coxswain Simulator 2012
=======================

Multiplayer internet racing game.

## Features

* Cross-browser 3D graphics using WebGL
* Node.js server hosted on an Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute instance (this is very experimental at the moment and is turned off)

Play it at <a href="http://www.walley.org.uk/cox-sim-2012/">http://www.walley.org.uk/cox-sim-2012/</a>.

You will need a recent web browser with support for WebGL. Chrome, Firefox and Safari latest builds should be sufficient.

If your luck is out then why not watch a video?

This is my attempt at learning Javascript and WebGL at the same time!
